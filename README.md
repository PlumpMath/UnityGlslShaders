Unity GLSL shaders
=========================
This repository contains basic glsl shader for Unity3D;
- Blur shader,
- Grayscale shader,
- Grayscale-Sepia tone shader,
- Vignette shader for Unity.

It's not recomended to use Glsl shaders with Unity (due to platform compatibility) so be careful with your platform if you are using these shaders!
